 * Barcode Count is a data capture mode that implements MatrixScan Count in use cases that include a counting workflow such as receiving, inventory count, and stock taking. MatrixScan Count is an out-of-the-box scan and count solution that enables faster and more accurate counting of multiple items at once.
 *
 * Learn more on how to use the mode in our Get Started With MatrixScan Count guide.
 *
 * This capture mode uses the barcode scanning and tracking capabilities. It cannot be used together with other capture modes that require the same capabilities, e.g. SDCBarcodeCapture.
